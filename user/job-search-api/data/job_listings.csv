• Experience with Design Libraries and/or Componentized Design Systems.
• Demonstrated track record of driving a user-centred design process to tackle complex customer problems in a startup environment.

• An iterative design process – always sketching, showing work in progress, and validating with customers and data.
• Appetite to ship working software in a timely manner.

While it’s not required, it’s an added plus if you have:
• Knowledge of common Mobile App Design Patterns (or open to exploring this)
